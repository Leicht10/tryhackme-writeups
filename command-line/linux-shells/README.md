## ðŸ“˜ Room Summary

This room introduces the **Linux command-line interface (CLI)** and core skills used to navigate and interact with Linux systems.

It's a foundation for all Linux-based pentesting, CTFs, privilege escalation, and real-world operations.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned

- Navigating Linux file systems (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`)
- File and directory operations (`touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`)
- Permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Reading files (`cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`)
- Piping and redirecting output (`|`, `>`, `>>`)
- Searching with `grep`, `find`, and `locate`
- Getting system/user info

## ðŸ’¬ Reflections

I already had basic Linux exposure, but this room helped me formalize my command-line skills and understand the Linux environment deeply.

Itâ€™s also a stepping stone toward privilege escalation, scripting, and forensic tasks in future rooms.
