# 📝 Extra Notes — Linux CLI

---

## Directories

- `/etc` — config files
- `/var/log` — logs
- `/home` — user directories
- `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin` — system commands

---

## File Permissions

- `rwx` = read, write, execute
- `chmod 755` = rwxr-xr-x
- `chown` changes ownership (user:group)

---

## Redirection & Pipes

- `command > file` — write to file
- `command >> file` — append to file
- `command | grep something` — filter output

---

## Useful Tips

- Use `history` to view past commands
- Use `man` to read manual pages (`man chmod`)
- Use tab completion for speed

---

## Reflection

This room made the Linux terminal feel more natural.  
I now know how to:
- Move through directories
- Manage permissions
- View and control processes
- Search files efficiently

The CLI is now one of my favorite tools.
