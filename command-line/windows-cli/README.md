## ðŸ’¬ Reflections

This room helped me become familiar with the **Windows CLI environment**, which Iâ€™d mostly ignored before. It feels like the Linux terminal in some ways but uses very different syntax.

Understanding CMD will help with **privilege escalation**, **internal enumeration**, and even **reverse shells** later.
