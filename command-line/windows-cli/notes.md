# üìù Extra Notes ‚Äî Windows CLI

---

## Windows Layout

- `C:\Users` holds all user profile directories
- `%APPDATA%` contains app-specific config and data
- `Program Files` = default install dir for 64-bit apps

---

## GUI vs CLI

- GUI = Explorer, Control Panel, Task Manager
- CLI = `cmd.exe`, `hostname`, `systeminfo`, `tasklist`

---

## Useful Shortcuts

- `cls` clears screen (like `clear` in Bash)
- `tab` autocompletes filenames
- `‚Üë` and `‚Üì` cycle through history

---

## Reflection

This room helped me **get comfortable with Windows internals** from a CLI perspective. I now understand how red teamers or system admins gather info and move around systems **without a GUI**.
