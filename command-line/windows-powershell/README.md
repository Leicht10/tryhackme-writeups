## ðŸ“˜ Room Summary

This room introduces **Windows PowerShell**, a task automation and configuration management framework built on .NET.

PowerShell is more powerful than CMD due to its scripting capabilities and use of objects instead of plain text.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned

- PowerShell uses **cmdlets** (e.g., `Get-Process`, `Set-ExecutionPolicy`)
- Can run `.ps1` scripts and pass objects between commands
- Supports variables, logic, and scripting
- Powerful for sysadmin and red team tasks

## ðŸ’¬ Reflections

PowerShell felt different from both CMD and Bash â€” but incredibly powerful.  
I now understand how attackers or sysadmins use it to automate tasks, run scripts, and access deep system info.

Itâ€™s definitely something Iâ€™ll practice more, especially scripting for automation or red team use cases.
