# üîê Cryptography Module

This module introduces the fundamentals of cryptography ‚Äî the science of securing information ‚Äî and explores how it applies in cybersecurity.  
It covers both the theory (encryption, hashing, key exchange) and hands-on practice with cryptographic tools.

üìò Module Summary

The Cryptography module explains how data can be protected using algorithms and protocols.  
It introduces classical ciphers, modern symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, and how these techniques are applied in real-world systems like SSL/TLS and digital signatures.  
The rooms also highlight common attacks against cryptography and why proper implementation is crucial.

üß† Key Concepts Learned

- Classical vs. modern ciphers
- Symmetric encryption (AES, DES, RC4)
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC, DH key exchange)
- Hashing (MD5, SHA family, bcrypt)
- Digital signatures and certificates
- Common attacks: brute force, replay attacks, weak key usage

üí¨ Reflections

This module helped me understand how cryptography underpins modern cybersecurity.  
I learned not only how encryption secures data, but also how mistakes in implementation can make systems vulnerable.  
It also made clear why attackers target weak hashes (like MD5) or poor key management.  
Having hands-on practice with OpenSSL and GPG gave me confidence to work with real-world cryptographic tools.
