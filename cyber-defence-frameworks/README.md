## üéØ Topics Covered

- Cyber Kill Chain (Recon to Action on Objectives)
- Pyramid of Pain and detection strategies
- Unified Kill Chain vs traditional model
- Diamond Model: Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, Victim
- MITRE ATT&CK framework and defensive tools
- Realistic simulation of blue team vs red team (Summit, Eviction)

## üß† Reflections

This module helped me build a strong theoretical foundation for incident response and threat detection.

Understanding attacker behavior patterns across frameworks will help me:
- Think like an adversary (red team)
- Detect and disrupt like an analyst (blue team)
- Communicate threats using structured models (MITRE, Diamond, Kill Chain)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Apply this knowledge in threat emulation labs
- Start creating threat models using MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Revisit this theory when building detection rules or analyzing logs
