ðŸ”— https://tryhackme.com/room/cyberkillchain

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain outlines 7 stages of an attack, from recon to objectives. Each phase can be used for detection and defense.

## ðŸ§  7 Stages

1. Reconnaissance  
2. Weaponization  
3. Delivery  
4. Exploitation  
5. Installation  
6. Command and Control  
7. Actions on Objectives

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection

This model helped me understand the attacker lifecycle and how blue teams detect/delay each stage. Itâ€™s foundational in both red and blue team ops.
