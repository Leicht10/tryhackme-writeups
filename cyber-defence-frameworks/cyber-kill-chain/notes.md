# ðŸŽ¯ Notes â€” Cyber Kill Chain

## The 7 Phases

1. Reconnaissance â€” Information gathering (WHOIS, Nmap, etc.)
2. Weaponization â€” Pair exploit with payload (e.g., reverse shell + macro)
3. Delivery â€” Send exploit (email, USB, malicious site)
4. Exploitation â€” Trigger exploit to gain access
5. Installation â€” Drop malware, set persistence
6. Command & Control â€” Adversary gains control (e.g., beaconing, C2 server)
7. Actions on Objectives â€” Exfiltration, destruction, persistence

## Detection Opportunity

- Early detection = less damage
- Kill Chain helps map alerts and logs to attacker intent

## My Reflection

This is the backbone of understanding how intrusions work. Itâ€™s useful to think where each log or alert fits into this model.
