# ðŸ’Ž Notes â€” Diamond Model

## Core Vertices

- Adversary
- Infrastructure
- Capability
- Victim

## Example Mapping

- Adversary = Threat group (e.g., APT29)
- Infrastructure = C2 server, phishing domain
- Capability = Malware, RAT
- Victim = Target org/system

## My Reflection

Itâ€™s useful for thinking about *relationships*, not just events. Helps track patterns and build detection logic across incidents.
