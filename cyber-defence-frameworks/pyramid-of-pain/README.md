# ðŸ“¶ TryHackMe â€” Pyramid of Pain  
ðŸ”— https://tryhackme.com/room/pyramidofpain

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

The Pyramid of Pain is a threat detection model showing how difficult it is for adversaries to change different types of indicators (hashes vs behavior).

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- Lower-level indicators like hash values and IPs are easy to change
- Higher-level indicators like TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) are harder to change
- Good detection = targeting high up the pyramid

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection

This room helped me understand the **value of behavior-based detection** over signature-based alerts. Itâ€™s a mindset shift toward resilience.
