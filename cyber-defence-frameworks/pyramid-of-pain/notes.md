# ðŸ“¶ Notes â€” Pyramid of Pain

## Pyramid Layers (Bottom to Top)

- Hash values (trivial)
- IP addresses (easy)
- Domain names (simple)
- Network/host artifacts (annoying)
- Tools (challenging)
- TTPs (tough)

## Core Idea

The higher up the pyramid you detect and block, the more disruptive you are to the attacker.

## Strategy Insight

- Hash blocking = weak
- Tool + behavior blocking = strong
- Target adversary habits, not just files

## My Reflection

This was a game-changing concept for me. It showed that not all indicators are equal â€” and good detection aims for *painful* layers.
