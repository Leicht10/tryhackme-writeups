ðŸ”— https://tryhackme.com/room/unifiedkillchain

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

An evolution of the Cyber Kill Chain combining MITRE ATT&CK and real-world attack flow. Designed to reflect modern, complex threats more accurately.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- 18 phases (vs 7 in CKC) that map better to real-world attacks
- Incorporates persistence, evasion, lateral movement
- Strong overlap with ATT&CK framework

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection

This was a great upgrade from CKC. It made me think more like an attacker and how they pivot between stages.
