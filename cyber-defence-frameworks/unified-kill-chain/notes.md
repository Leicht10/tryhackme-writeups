# ðŸ§¬ Notes â€” Unified Kill Chain

## How It's Different

- Builds on Cyber Kill Chain + MITRE
- Contains **18 stages** â€” more accurate to real attacks
- Adds lateral movement, evasion, persistence, exfiltration stages

## Phases (might re-occur)

- Phase :In (Initial Foothold)
- Phase :Through (Network Propogation)
- Phase :Out (Action on Objective)

## My Reflection

While CKC is linear, this felt more realistic. It reflects how real APTs behave â€” adapting, retrying, and shifting goals over time.
