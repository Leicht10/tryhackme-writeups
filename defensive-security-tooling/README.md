# 🛠️ Defensive Security Tooling Module

This module provides hands-on exposure to tools defenders use to collect telemetry, hunt for threats, and respond to incidents.

---

📘 Module Summary

The Defensive Tooling module focuses on practical tooling: log collection, endpoint and network sensors, forensic utilities, and basic automation for triage. Labs demonstrate how to gather evidence and perform initial investigations.

---

🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- Collecting and centralizing logs (syslog, WinEvent)
- Basic threat hunting workflows
- Using EDR/OSQuery/Zeek for telemetry collection
- Forensic basics: disk and memory artifacts
- Automating common triage tasks with scripts

---

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored

- OSQuery, Zeek (network), Suricata (IDS)
- Sysmon / Windows event logs
- Forensics utilities (Autopsy, volatility — conceptual)
- Scripting for automation (Python, PowerShell)
- Logging formats (JSON, syslog)

💬 Reflections

This module made it clear that defenders need both breadth and speed: many data sources must be correlated quickly to detect real incidents. Building simple automation and getting comfortable with telemetry were the most practical outcomes.
