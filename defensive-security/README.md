# 🛡️ Defensive Security Module

This module covers the principles and practices defenders use to protect networks, systems, and data. It introduces monitoring, detection, incident response, and the security controls used to reduce risk.

---

📘 Module Summary

The Defensive Security module explains monitoring strategies, logging, detection engineering, and incident handling. It highlights how defenders use telemetry (logs, network captures, EDR) and frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK) to detect and respond to threats.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- Security monitoring and log collection (SIEM concepts)
- Detection engineering and alert tuning
- Incident response lifecycle (identify, contain, eradicate, recover)
- Endpoint detection & response (EDR) basics
- Network defenses: segmentation, IDS/IPS, firewalls
- Mapping observations to MITRE ATT&CK

---

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored

- SIEM basics (Splunk, Elastic stack concepts)
- EDR concepts (Carbon Black, CrowdStrike — conceptual)
- OSQuery, Zeek/Bro for network telemetry
- Log parsing and search (jq, grep, Kibana)
- MITRE ATT&CK for detection mapping

💬 Reflections

Defensive work felt like a puzzle: turning noisy telemetry into reliable signals. I learned that detection relies heavily on good data collection and realistic tuning — false positives drown analysts, while blind spots let attackers operate. Incident response drills are crucial to reduce reaction time.
