# 💥 TryHackMe - Exploitation Basics Module

## 📖 Overview
- **Module URL**: https://tryhackme.com/module/exploitation-basics  
- **Difficulty**: Easy → Medium  
- **Focus**: Learning the foundations of exploitation and practical use of Metasploit  

The Exploitation Basics module introduces the **core concepts of exploitation** and walks through practical labs using Metasploit and real-world vulnerabilities (like EternalBlue).

## 📂 Rooms in this Module
1. **Moniker Link**  
   - Learn about Windows COM object persistence and exploitation.  

2. **Metasploit Introduction**  
   - Get familiar with the structure of Metasploit modules (exploits, payloads, auxiliary).  

3. **Metasploit Exploitation**  
   - Use Metasploit to exploit a vulnerable service and gain a shell.  

4. **Metasploit Meterpreter**  
   - Learn the power of Meterpreter for post-exploitation (dumping hashes, pivoting, migration).  

5. **Blue**  
   - Practical exploitation of the **EternalBlue (MS17-010)** SMBv1 vulnerability with Metasploit.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- [x] Understand exploitation and persistence mechanisms  
- [x] Learn the structure and workflow of Metasploit  
- [x] Exploit a real-world SMBv1 vulnerability (EternalBlue)  
- [x] Practice post-exploitation with Meterpreter  
- [x] Map attacks to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- `Metasploit Framework` (`msfconsole`)  
- `nmap` for enumeration  
- `netcat` for reverse shells  
- Windows privilege escalation utilities (within labs)

## 🖥️ Module Walkthrough (High-Level)
1. **Moniker Link** → Intro to exploitation via Windows COM hijacking.  
2. **Metasploit Intro** → Learn Metasploit module types & commands.  
3. **Metasploit Exploitation** → Run an exploit → get shell access.  
4. **Metasploit Meterpreter** → Explore post-exploitation with Meterpreter commands.  
5. **Blue** → Exploit EternalBlue and fully compromise a vulnerable Windows target.  

---

## 🏁 Key Takeaways
- Exploitation is about leveraging **vulnerabilities** → not magic.  
- Metasploit is a **powerful exploitation framework** that simplifies attacks.  
- Post-exploitation is critical: persistence, privilege escalation, and data collection.  
- EternalBlue is a classic case study in **critical vulnerabilities** being used in real-world attacks (WannaCry).
