📘 Room Summary  
This room demonstrates exploitation of the **EternalBlue (MS17-010)** vulnerability in SMBv1, famously used in the WannaCry ransomware attack. It walks through scanning, exploiting with Metasploit, and using Meterpreter for post-exploitation.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- How to detect SMBv1 with `nmap`
- EternalBlue exploit and how it works
- Using Metasploit exploit module `ms17_010_eternalblue`
- Gaining SYSTEM-level Meterpreter access
- Basic post-exploitation tasks (hashdump, sysinfo)

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored
- `nmap` with SMB scripts
- Metasploit exploit: `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
- Payloads: Windows reverse meterpreter
- SMB protocol vulnerabilities

💬 Reflections  
Blue was one of the most impactful rooms because it demonstrated a **real-world critical vulnerability**. It showed how attackers leveraged EternalBlue for devastating global attacks. Running it in a safe lab helped me appreciate why **patch management** and **regular vulnerability scanning** are essential in enterprise security.
