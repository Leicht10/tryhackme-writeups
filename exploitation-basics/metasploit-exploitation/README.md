📘 Room Summary  
This room demonstrates how to use Metasploit to exploit a vulnerable service and gain initial access. It focuses on the exploitation workflow inside msfconsole and shows how to achieve a working shell on the target.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Searching and selecting exploits in Metasploit
- Setting target parameters (`RHOST`, `RPORT`)
- Configuring payloads
- Launching exploits to gain access
- Using post-exploitation modules after initial access

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored
- `msfconsole`
- Exploit modules (targeting Windows/Linux)
- Payloads (reverse shells, meterpreter)
- Post modules (`hashdump`, `sysinfo`)

💬 Reflections  
This room helped me practice the **hands-on workflow** of exploitation. Seeing an exploit run and give me a shell made the process very clear. It reinforced that **enumeration + correct exploit selection** are critical — Metasploit does the heavy lifting, but I need to supply good recon data.
