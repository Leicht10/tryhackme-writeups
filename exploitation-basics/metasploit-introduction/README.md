📘 Room Summary  
This room introduces the **Metasploit Framework (MSF)** — a penetration testing platform with hundreds of exploits, payloads, and auxiliary modules. It explains module structure and demonstrates the workflow of preparing and running exploits.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Types of Metasploit modules (Exploit, Payload, Auxiliary, Post)
- Common msfconsole commands: `search`, `use`, `set`, `exploit`
- How payloads are delivered (reverse shell vs bind shell)
- The workflow: enumerate → select exploit → configure → launch

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored
- `msfconsole`
- Exploit modules
- Payload modules (reverse_tcp, meterpreter)
- Auxiliary scanning modules

💬 Reflections  
This room showed how Metasploit simplifies exploitation. It’s powerful for beginners and professionals, but I also realized the importance of **not relying only on MSF** — knowing the manual techniques helps me understand what’s happening in the background.
