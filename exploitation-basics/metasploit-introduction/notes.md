[Extra Notes – Metasploit Introduction]

Metasploit Framework

- Open-source penetration testing framework.  
- Provides modules: Exploits, Payloads, Auxiliary, Post.  

Basic Commands

- `search` – find exploits or payloads.  
- `use` – load a module.  
- `set` – configure options (RHOST, RPORT, PAYLOAD).  
- `exploit` – run the exploit.  

Payloads

- Reverse shell – target connects back to attacker.  
- Bind shell – attacker connects to target.  

Reflection

- First hands-on look at Metasploit.  
- Helped me understand automation in exploitation, but also reminded me why **manual skills** are important.
