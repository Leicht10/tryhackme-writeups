📘 Room Summary  
This room covers the **Meterpreter payload**, one of Metasploit’s most powerful post-exploitation tools. It provides an in-memory shell with advanced capabilities like privilege escalation, process migration, and credential dumping.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Meterpreter commands (`sysinfo`, `getuid`, `hashdump`, `migrate`)
- How to interact with the compromised system
- Persistence and privilege escalation with Meterpreter
- The difference between simple shells and Meterpreter sessions

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored
- `meterpreter` payloads
- Commands: `sysinfo`, `getuid`, `hashdump`, `migrate`
- Privilege escalation techniques

💬 Reflections  
Meterpreter showed me how **post-exploitation is as important as exploitation**. Getting a shell is just the beginning — the real value is in what you can do afterwards: gather creds, escalate, persist. I also saw why defenders must monitor post-exploitation behavior, not just initial access.
