[Extra Notes – Metasploit Meterpreter]

Meterpreter Basics

- Advanced Metasploit payload.  
- Runs in memory (stealthier than normal shells).  

Commands

- `sysinfo` – show system info.  
- `getuid` – current user.  
- `hashdump` – dump password hashes.  
- `migrate` – move into another process.  

Features

- Privilege escalation.  
- Persistence modules.  
- File system browsing.  

Reflection

- Learned that **getting a shell is just the beginning**.  
- Meterpreter makes post-exploitation powerful and flexible.  
- Also highlighted why defenders must monitor for post-exploitation behavior.
