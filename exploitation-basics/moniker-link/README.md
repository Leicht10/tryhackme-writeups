📘 Room Summary  
This room introduces the concept of **Moniker CLSIDs** in Windows — unique identifiers for COM objects — and how they can be abused for persistence or exploitation. Attackers can hijack CLSIDs to trick the system into executing malicious code.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- What COM objects and Moniker CLSIDs are in Windows
- How attackers abuse CLSIDs for persistence
- Registry paths attackers commonly target
- Defensive strategies to detect CLSID hijacking

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored
- Windows Registry (`HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID`)
- COM (Component Object Model)
- Persistence mechanisms on Windows

💬 Reflections  
This room gave me insight into how **deep Windows internals** can be abused for persistence. It showed me that defenders need visibility not just at the process level, but also in registry keys and COM object usage. Even though it was theory-heavy, it connected the dots between exploitation and persistence.
