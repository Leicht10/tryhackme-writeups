Windows CLSIDs

- CLSIDs = unique identifiers for COM objects.  
- Stored in registry under `HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID`.  

Exploitation

- Attackers can hijack CLSID references to point to malicious executables.  
- Common persistence technique on Windows.  

Defense

- Monitor registry changes to CLSID keys.  
- Use Sysinternals tools or Windows logging to detect unusual COM usage.  

Reflection

- Learned how **Windows internals** like COM can be abused for persistence.  
- Showed me that persistence can be very stealthy, not just startup programs or services.
