# Extra Notes – Linux Fundamentals Part 1

## File System Structure
- `/` is the root of the file system.
- Common directories:
  - `/home` → user home directories
  - `/etc` → configuration files
  - `/bin` and `/usr/bin` → system binaries

## Commands & Tips
- `ls -la` shows hidden files and details.
- `cat` quickly displays file content.
- `less` is useful for scrolling large files.

## Reflection
- I found it interesting how many hidden files exist in a user’s home directory (`.bashrc`, `.profile`).
- It took some time to get used to using `cd ..` vs `cd /`.

## To Review Later
- Absolute vs relative paths
- Differences between `cat`, `less`, and `more`
