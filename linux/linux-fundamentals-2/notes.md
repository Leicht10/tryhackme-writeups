# Extra Notes – Linux Fundamentals Part 2

## File Permissions
- `rwx` stands for Read, Write, Execute.
- Permissions are split into user, group, and others.

## chmod Basics
- `chmod +x` → adds executable permission.
- Numeric mode: 755 = rwxr-xr-x.

## chown
- Changes ownership of a file.
- Format: `chown user:group file`

## Reflection
- The `chmod` numeric notation was tricky at first, but now it makes sense.
- This lesson helped me understand how attackers might exploit poor file permissions.
