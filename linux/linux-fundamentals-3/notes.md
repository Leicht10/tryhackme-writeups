# Extra Notes â€“ Linux Fundamentals Part 3

## Process Management
- `ps aux` lists all running processes.
- `top` shows live system activity.

## Killing Processes
- `kill -9 PID` force-kills a process.
- `htop` is an advanced alternative to `top`.

## Package Management
- `apt` handles software installations in Debian-based systems.

## Reflection
- Managing services with `systemctl` helped me understand what background services are running and how to interact with them.
- I want to explore the difference between `service` and `systemctl` more deeply.
