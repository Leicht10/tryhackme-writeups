üí¨ Reflections

This module helped solidify my foundation in networking, which is essential for cybersecurity.  
I now understand not only how devices connect and communicate, but also where attackers can exploit weaknesses.  
Learning Wireshark and basic CLI networking tools gave me practical skills for both troubleshooting and security testing.  
Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity, and this module provided the base for advanced topics like exploitation, web security, and defensive monitoring.
