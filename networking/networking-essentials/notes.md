[Extra Notes – Networking Essentials]

IP Addressing

- IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit.
- Private ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16.
- Subnet masks divide networks into smaller subnets.

CLI Basics

- `ping 8.8.8.8` → test connectivity.
- `traceroute example.com` → see path packets take.
- `nslookup example.com` / `dig example.com` → DNS resolution.

Routing

- `ip route` → show routing table.
- Default gateway forwards traffic outside local subnet.

Reflection

- Subnetting is a core skill for security and system administration.
- Learned how to identify and troubleshoot basic connectivity issues.
