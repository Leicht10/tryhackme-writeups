[Extra Notes – Networking Secure Protocols]

HTTP vs HTTPS

- HTTPS uses TLS/SSL for encryption.
- Prevents eavesdropping and MITM attacks.

SSH

- Secure remote login.
- `ssh user@host` → encrypted session.
- Safer replacement for Telnet.

TLS/SSL

- Provides encryption, authentication, and integrity.
- Certificates validate server identity.

VPNs

- Tunnel traffic securely across public networks.
- Can use SSL, IPsec, or WireGuard.

Reflection

- Secure protocols are a must in any environment.
- Learned why insecure protocols (Telnet, FTP) are phased out.
