📘 Room Summary

This room introduces `tcpdump`, a powerful command-line packet capture tool. It is lightweight and often used on servers where GUIs are unavailable.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- Capturing traffic on interfaces
- Using filters to target protocols/ports
- Saving and reading `.pcap` files
- Comparing `tcpdump` with Wireshark

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored

- tcpdump syntax
- Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF)
- pcap files

💬 Reflections

Tcpdump gave me confidence working without a GUI. It's a must-know tool for real-world environments where Wireshark isn’t practical.
