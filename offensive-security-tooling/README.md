🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- Reconnaissance workflow: discovery → enumeration → exploitation
- Use of scanners (nmap), web proxies (Burp), and exploit frameworks (Metasploit)
- Payload construction and delivery (reverse shells, staged payloads)
- Automation and chaining tools for efficient assessments
- Ethical considerations: scope, authorization, and reporting

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored

- nmap, masscan
- Metasploit Framework (msfconsole, meterpreter)
- Burp Suite (scanning, intruder)
- Empire / C2 basics (lab-only concepts)
- Scripting for automation (Python, bash)

💬 Reflections

Tooling accelerates real-world testing but must be paired with strong fundamentals: good recon, judgment, and clear rules of engagement. I learned how frameworks simplify tasks, but also why manual verification and understanding the underlying protocols are essential.
