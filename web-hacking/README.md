# 🌐 Web Hacking Module

This module covers the core concepts and practical techniques used to find and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. It balances theory (how web apps work and why they break) with hands-on labs to practice common attacks.

---

📘 Module Summary

The Web Hacking module explains HTTP fundamentals, web app architectures, and common classes of vulnerabilities (injection, auth flaws, XSS, CSRF, file upload issues, insecure direct object references). Hands-on exercises teach exploitation, validation, and remediation techniques.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- HTTP basics: requests, responses, headers, cookies, sessions
- OWASP Top 10 classes (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Authentication and session management weaknesses
- Input validation and output encoding
- File upload and insecure deserialization vulnerabilities
- Basic secure development and remediation strategies

---

🛠️ Tools / Terms Explored

- Burp Suite (proxy and scanner)
- curl, wget
- Browser developer tools
- sqlmap (automated SQLi testing)
- Web shells and reverse shells (in lab environments)
- OWASP ZAP

💬 Reflections

This module made clear how many vulnerabilities stem from simple mistakes: lack of validation, bad session handling, or misplaced trust in client input. Hands-on labs with Burp Suite and manual testing helped me appreciate both automation and manual verification when assessing web apps.
