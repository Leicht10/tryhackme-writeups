## 💬 Reflections

This room helped me understand how organizations manage large networks securely using centralized control. Learning how attackers abuse AD structures (e.g., privilege escalation or lateral movement) makes this topic essential for any cybersecurity path.

I want to explore how tools like **BloodHound**, **SharpHound**, and **Kerberoasting** are used in real AD attacks.
