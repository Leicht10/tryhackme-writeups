# Extra Notes â€“ Active Directory Basics

## What is Active Directory?
- A centralized directory service that authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain network.

## Key Terms
- **Domain**: Logical group of network objects (users, computers).
- **OU (Organizational Unit)**: Like a folder to organize AD objects.
- **Domain Controller (DC)**: A server that handles authentication.
- **GPO (Group Policy Object)**: Settings applied across machines or users.
- **Kerberos**: Protocol used for authentication in AD.

## Workgroup vs Domain
- **Workgroup**: No central management. Each machine is standalone.
- **Domain**: Centralized control using AD.

## Reflection
Understanding AD is crucial for both offensive and defensive security. Nearly every enterprise uses AD, so knowing how it's structured and how attackers abuse it is critical for any cybersecurity role.
