- `C:\Users` contains user profiles.
- `%APPDATA%` holds config files for many apps.

## GUI vs CLI
- Control Panel = GUI
- `hostname`, `whoami`, `systeminfo` = CLI

## Reflection
- This was my first exposure to Windows internals. It helped bridge what I knew about Linux into a Windows environment.
