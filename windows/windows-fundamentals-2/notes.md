- Central database for configuration settings.
- Editing registry values can break a system — handle with care.

## Startup & Services
- `services.msc` shows running and stopped background services.
- `msconfig` controls startup items and boot config.

## Reflection
- Understanding the Windows registry helps in both offensive (e.g., persistence) and defensive (e.g., detection) security.
