# Extra Notes â€“ Windows Fundamentals Part 3

## User Account Control (UAC)
- Helps prevent unauthorized changes to the OS.

## RDP (Remote Desktop)
- `mstsc` launches the RDP client.

## Windows Defender
- Built-in antivirus; good for quick protection but can be bypassed by attackers.

## Reflection
- I realized how important default protections are, and why attackers often disable or avoid Defender.
